# Rafail Courses Bot

Learning management system adapted for telegram bot, which is used to moderate my own courses

**Link to bot:** https://t.me/innoprog_bot

It has personal accounts for both the `teacher` and the `student`.

**The student can:**
- choose the course that suits him
- pay for the chosen course
- join the online class (conference)
- communicate personally with the teacher
- submit homework assignments for review and receive feedback from the teacher 
- view records of completed classes

**The teacher can:**
- start a conference, automatically notifying all students of this course
- posting notes of lessons with homework assignments
- simultaneously send messages to all students of this course
- check homework (accept or reject) + give feedback

The bot was created to `automate the learning system process`, which will make it easier for teachers to work and students to learn. 
In addition, it helps me to moderate the process of completing the course. 
For example, if the teacher has not checked his homework within 24 hours, I will receive a message about this.
